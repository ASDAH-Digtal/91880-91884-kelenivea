     <h3>  Hebrews 13:14 " For this world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come."   </h3>
     <p style="font-size: 30px"> I Come from Gods Heavenly Kingdom because I am His Daughter. He says in "If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." He chose me out of this world to be one of His own. When he died for my sins on that Cross and rose again, he went home to His Father in heaven. John 14:2-3 tells us that he goes back to prepare a place for me and all his followers and that in His Fathers house has many rooms. He will come back one day to take me, along with our other brothers and sisters in christ, Home!
