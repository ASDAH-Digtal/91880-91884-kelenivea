      God and His Word
    </h3>

  <p style="font-size: 17px"> <b>
  God has been the biggest helper in my life. He has been with me through alot, and although i am not perfect He still loves me. His Word, gives me the most encouragement in low times and even highs aswell. Jesus' sacrifice on the cross is what i call "TRUE LOVE"! Everyone wants to be loved and this world tries to decieve us that true love can be found in this world, but GOD is what the real definition of TRUE LOVE. This is the reason i am drawn to God, cause his love is grater than anything and anyone! God bless.</b>

       Brass band (Euphonium)
     </h3>


    <p style="font-size: 17px">  <b>
    The brass band has been one of my hobbies because ive grown up knowing my father played, and i wanted to be just like him and someday play with him. He plays the cornet while i play the Euphonium and although these two intruments are different, they sound really nice when played in duet. </b>

     <h3>
       Sports (Netball)
     </h3>
    
     <p style="font-size: 17px"> <b> Netball is a ball sport played by two teams of seven players. Games are played on a rectangular court with raised goal rings at each end. The object is to score goals from within a defined area, by throwing a ball into a ring attached to a 3.05 metres (10 feet) high post. </b>

     <p style="font-size: 17px">  <b>
       I play in the senior netball team for my school as Goal keeper (GK-Defender). I love the game of netball because i like jumping and contesting for the ball. Netball, is a non-contact sport which has rules and consequences for contacts that happens in a game. It can really trains the mind and body to be well diciplined with contacts. </b>

<h3> Entertainment </h3>
<p style="font-size: 15px"> <b>
 NRL stands for National Rugby League. This is a national rugby league premiership that is made of 16 teams which is all Australian teams with One New Zealand team called the 'warriors'. This sport is very different to Netball. Rugby league is all about contact! while netball is the complete opposite. my insterest in league started from the MMT, which represented Tonga in the RWLC. Most of the tongan players play in the Australian NRL clubs. From there, I enjoyed watching league and found interest in NRL and the game. My favourite NRl teams are the Broncos and the Warriors. No time to explain why... but my state of origin team is QLD!
