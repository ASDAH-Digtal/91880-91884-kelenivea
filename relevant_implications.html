    <h1>Relevant implications</h1>
    
    <br>

    <h3>Relevant implication #1: [ Intellectual property]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[Intellectual property refers to an individual's creation being their own. Images and texts that belong to someone else, but I have used, come from a free-copyright website. The photos in the website are free and people have allowed others to download their images.  ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[To make sure I used the relevant implications of intellectual property, I used images from free copyright websites like unsplash and pixabay. These websites allow other users to download good, high-quality images for free. ]</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Relevant implication #2: [End-user considerations]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[ 

End-User Considerations is a person who is intended to use a product. Whoever uses my website, I take in to considerations of what they will think and how they will feel when scrolling through my website. I need to take into consideration whether the end user can read my website clearly- if the font sizes and other things meet their needs. ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[ 

 For me to address the relevant implication, I made sure that the text, images and fonts sizes have been set to a decent size where all people will have the chance to read the texts clearly and see everything well. There are texts that are in a different language and has translations for people who may not understand.  ]</p>

    <h3>Relevant implication #3: [Accessibility]</h3>
    <strong>Describe relevant implication</strong>
    <p>[Accessibility is whether users can access the website in a different device.  ]</p>

    <strong>Address relevant implication in relation to your website</strong>
    <p>[To ensure I used the relevant implications of Accessibility, I made sure that the grid of the website will change at a different grid when accessed on a different sized device. For example, the website is coded to fit the frame of a computer but it will be viewed differently on a smaller frame like a phone. So, I changed the grid of the website when it reaches a specific width, so that the website can be viewed nicely despite the difference of device size. ]</p>
